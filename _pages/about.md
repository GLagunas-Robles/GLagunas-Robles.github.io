I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://www.ryanbracewell.com/people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Bracewell</a> at Indiana University. I earned my PhD in the department of Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at the University of California, Riverside with my dissertation advisor, <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/alanbe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Brelsford</a>. 

As an evolutionary biologist, I am fundamentally interested in genome evolution and the maintenance of diverging traits. In my PhD, I worked with _Formica_ ants to answer questions pertaining to the genetics underlying colony sex ratio and social organization. Currently, I am working to understand how and why different neo-sex chromosomes are maintained in the mountain pine beetle. You can learn more about my research interests, and past works, <a href="https://glagunas-robles.github.io/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. If you are interested in collaborating or discussing ideas, you can reach me at glaguna [at] iu [dot] edu.
