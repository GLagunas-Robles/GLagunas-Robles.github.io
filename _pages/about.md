Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://www.ryanbracewell.com/people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Bracewell</a> at Indiana University. I earned my PhD in the department of Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at the University of California, Riverside in 2024 in the lab of my dissertation advisor, <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/alanbe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Brelsford</a>. 

As an evolutionary biologist, I am fundamentally interested in how the genome and changes in genome structure maintain diverging traits. Structural variation can play a key role in maintaining differences between alternative phenotypes, such as phenotypic morphs and life history strategies. Genomic regions containing two or more linked functional mutations that control discrete traits are often referred to as "supergenes." Oftentimes, supergenes are inversions, but other structural variants and ploidy differences fall under the supergene umbrella.

In my PhD, I worked with _Formica_ ants to answer questions pertaining to the genetics underlying colony sex ratio and social organization. Currently, I am working to understand how and why different neo-sex chromosomes are maintained in Mountain Pine Beetles.
